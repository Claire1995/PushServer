# PushServer
Made push notification web server to send device key from android mobile device 


## Process
1. Made an android application for scheduling of collegues during internship
2. To send notification from window server to each devices, **need to get keys of each devices first**(when application installed)
3. I was intern not allowed to approach to company web server, so I made web server with Node.js and made proto type. 

## What I used for this
1. Android studio with Java
2. Node.js with JS
3. HTTP protocol
